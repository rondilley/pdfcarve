## What is PDF Carver (pdfcarve)?

PDF Carver is a simple command line tool for viewing and extracting
interesting data from PDF files.

## Why use it?

If you have a PDF that you suspect contains something malicious,
this tool may help you better understand the files nature.

## Implementation

Below are the options that wirespy supports.

```
pdfcarve v0.8 [Jul 14 2025 - 14:14:37]

syntax: pdfcarve [options]
 -d|--debug (0-9)     enable debugging info
 -h|--help            this info
 -v|--version         display version information
 -w|--write           write streams to disk
```

## Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the pdfcarve source that
would allow a specially crafted file to allow an attacker
to exploit pdfcarve to gain access to the computer that it is
running on!!! Don't trust this software and install and use
is at your own risk.

## Bugs

I am not a programmer by any strech of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
